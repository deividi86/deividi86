## Deividi Silva
Currently VP of Tech at Gun.io. My software development journey spans multiple areas, from hands-on coding to leadership. As someone who thrives on the constant learning curve in technology, I eagerly collaborate on projects that resonate with my skill set.

### Personal Traits & Work Style
My enthusiasm for novel ideas is balanced by focusing on the bigger picture. I value transparent communication and sometimes may come off as blunt because I believe in the growth potential. I'm driven by autonomy and a flexible schedule. I'm an early bird and tend to block my calendar for deep work in the morning.

### Motivation & Values
I am motivated by continuous learning, clear objectives, creative problem-solving, and positive team dynamics. I appreciate curiosity, open-mindedness, collaboration, integrity, and resilience in myself and my peers.

### How to Collaborate with Me
Autonomy, open discussions, clear expectations, and a balanced work-life are keys to a productive collaboration with me. By recognizing our strengths and weaknesses, I believe we can support each other and achieve great things.

I'm always open to feedback and eager to learn and grow together!
