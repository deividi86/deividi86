### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently VP, Tech at Gun.io. I have years of experience in various areas of the software development lifecycle. I've had the opportunity to work alongside fast-growing companies worldwide and I enjoy coming up with projects on the side. Throughout my journey, I've endeavored to contribute to hands-on coding, systems design and architecture, leadership, coaching, agile development, and people management while building a range of software solutions, from MVPs to highly scalable distributed systems.

My goal has always been to collaborate remotely with teams and offer my expertise in building effective, reliable, and practical solutions to complex challenges. I'm grateful to have been able to help global companies, startups, and web agencies reach their business goals using technology, while staying on time and within budget.

Please don't hesitate to reach out if you think there's any way we can collaborate. I'm always eager to learn something new!
